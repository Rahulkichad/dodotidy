## Comparison with Paid Alternatives

DodoTidy is a free and open-source alternative to paid macOS system cleaners like CleanMyMac X, MacKeeper, and DaisyDisk. It offers comparable features without the subscription fees or one-time purchase costs.

## Safety Guardrails

DodoTidy is designed with multiple safety mechanisms to protect your data:

### 1. Trash-based deletion (Recoverable)

All file deletions use macOS's `trashItem()` API, which moves files to Trash instead of permanently deleting them. You can always recover accidentally deleted files from Trash.

### 2. Protected paths

The following paths are protected by default and will never be cleaned:

- `~/Documents` - Your documents
- `~/Desktop` - Desktop files
- `~/Pictures`, `~/Movies`, `~/Music` - Media libraries
- `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg` - Security keys
- `~/.aws`, `~/.kube` - Cloud credentials
- `~/Library/Keychains` - System keychains
- `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync` - iOS device backups

You can customize protected paths in Settings.

### 3. Safe vs manual-only categories

**Safe auto-clean paths** (used by scheduled tasks):
- Browser caches (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- Application caches (Spotify, Slack, Discord, VS Code, Zoom, Teams)
- Xcode DerivedData

**Manual-only paths** (require explicit user action, never auto-cleaned):
- **Downloads** - May contain important unprocessed files
- **Trash** - Emptying is IRREVERSIBLE
- **System logs** - May be needed for troubleshooting
- **Developer caches** (npm, Yarn, Homebrew, pip, CocoaPods, Gradle, Maven) - May require lengthy re-downloads
- **Orphaned app data** - Leftover folders from uninstalled apps (requires careful review)

### 4. Dry run mode

Enable "Dry run mode" in Settings to preview exactly what files would be deleted without actually deleting anything. This shows:
- File paths
- File sizes
- Modification dates
- Total count and size

### 5. File age filter

Set a minimum file age (in days) to only clean files older than a specified threshold. This prevents accidentally deleting recently created or modified files.

Example: Set to 7 days to only clean files that haven't been modified in the past week.

### 6. Scheduled task confirmation

When "Confirm scheduled tasks" is enabled (default), scheduled cleaning tasks will:
- Send a notification when ready to run
- Wait for user confirmation before executing
- Never auto-clean without user review

### 7. User-space only operations

DodoTidy operates entirely within user space:
- No sudo or root privileges required
- Cannot modify system files
- Cannot affect other users' data
- All operations limited to `~/` paths

### 8. Safe optimizer commands

The optimizer only runs well-known, safe system commands:
- `dscacheutil -flushcache` - Flush DNS cache
- `qlmanage -r cache` - Reset Quick Look thumbnails
- `lsregister` - Rebuild Launch Services database

No destructive or risky system commands are included.

### 9. Orphaned app data detection

DodoTidy can detect leftover data from applications you've uninstalled:

**Scanned locations:**
- `~/Library/Application Support`
- `~/Library/Caches`
- `~/Library/Preferences`
- `~/Library/Containers`
- `~/Library/Saved Application State`
- `~/Library/Logs`
- And 6 more Library locations

**Safety measures:**
- Smart matching against installed apps using bundle IDs
- Excludes all Apple system services (`com.apple.*`)
- Excludes common system components and developer tools
- Items default to unselected - you must explicitly choose what to clean
- Aggressive warning displayed before cleaning
- Entire folder is moved to Trash (recoverable)

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap dodoapps/tap
brew install --cask dodotidy
xattr -cr /Applications/DodoTidy.app
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/dodoapps/dodotidy/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag DodoTidy to Applications
3. Right-click and select "Open" on first launch (required for unsigned apps)

Or run: `xattr -cr /Applications/DodoTidy.app`

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for building from source)

## Building from Source

### Using XcodeGen (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install-dependencies

# Generate Xcode project
make generate-project

# Build the app
make build

# Run the app
make run
```

### Using Xcode directly

1. Run `make generate-project` to create the Xcode project
2. Open `DodoTidy.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

## Architecture

The app uses a provider-based architecture:

- **DodoTidyService**: Main coordinator that manages all providers
- **StatusProvider**: System metrics collection using native macOS APIs
- **AnalyzerProvider**: Disk space analysis using FileManager
- **CleanerProvider**: Cache and temporary file cleanup with safety guardrails
- **OptimizerProvider**: System optimization tasks
- **UninstallProvider**: App uninstallation with related file detection

All providers use Swift's `@Observable` macro for reactive state management.

## Settings

Access Settings from the app menu or sidebar to configure:

- **General**: Launch at login, menu bar icon, refresh interval
- **Cleaning**: Confirm before cleaning, dry run mode, file age filter
- **Protected paths**: Paths that should never be cleaned
- **Notifications**: Low disk space alerts, scheduled task notifications

## Design system

- **Primary color**: #13715B (Green)
- **Background**: #0F1419 (Dark)
- **Text primary**: #F9FAFB
- **Border radius**: 4px
- **Button height**: 34px
